# install.ps1 — the Windows-native installer for Prime Agent (Rust build).
#
# THE ONE-LINER (the served copy carries the official domain + the stable
# channel rendered in by the release pipeline's publish step):
#
#   irm https://app.primeintellect.ai/prime-agent/install.ps1 | iex
#
# The repo copy's defaults are the same bucket-root base, so the raw form
# works out of the box too (the README's Windows command):
#
#   irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-agent/main/install.ps1 | iex
#
# The Git Bash route is the same channel through install-rust.sh (the sh
# one-liner `curl -fsSL .../install.sh | sh` under Git Bash/MSYS2/Cygwin);
# this script is the PowerShell-native form. Both routes publish the SAME
# layout — $PREFIX\share\prime-agent\ (the payload) and $PREFIX\bin\
# (the launcher pair) — so either route can update the other's install.
#
# THE CHANNEL (install-rust.sh parity): the channel pointer (<base>/stable
# or <base>/beta) gives the version, the channel manifest (<base>/latest.json
# or <base>/beta.json) gives this platform's artifact row, and the versioned
# release prefix serves the tarball plus its SHA256SUMS; the checksum is
# verified before anything is published. NO GITHUB SURFACE anywhere in the
# user path.
#
# THE WINDOWS CHANNEL FALLBACK: the stable releases predate Windows
# support, so the stable manifest carries no win32-x64 row until the first
# stable release ships one; a default-channel Windows install falls back
# to the beta channel with a printed notice, and a channel asked for by
# name refuses instead (the beta route spelled out).
#
# NO TYPESCRIPT TAKEOVER STEPS: the TypeScript product never shipped a
# Windows build, so there is no TS daemon, native install, or npm package
# to retire here — this installer publishes the Rust payload and stops
# this product's own daemon for the swap (a Windows process holds its
# binary open; the payload swap needs the daemon down first).
#
# Configuration (environment, install-rust.sh's own knobs):
#   PRIME_AGENT_DOWNLOAD_BASE_URL  the R2-backed download base
#   PRIME_AGENT_RELEASE_CHANNEL    stable | beta
#   PRIME_AGENT_VERSION            pin an exact version
#   PRIME_AGENT_RUST_PREFIX        install prefix (default: $HOME\.local)
#
# Prerequisites: Windows 10+ (tar.exe and Get-FileHash ship with the OS;
# the kernel's Python runtime bootstraps through uv on first session — the
# pre-warm below installs the venv when uv is available).

# The whole body runs in a child scope: under `irm | iex` the script shares
# the caller's session, so the Stop preference and the installer's own
# variables must not stay behind in it, and a refusal must return to the
# prompt (Fail throws) instead of closing the user's PowerShell. The body
# stays unindented so the publish render's line-anchored sed still matches.
# Any failure reaches the catch at the bottom: run as a file it exits 1 (in
# PowerShell 7 and Windows PowerShell 5.1 alike, never relying on how an
# uncaught error or a trap's break maps to the exit code); under `irm | iex`
# ($PSCommandPath is empty) it rethrows to the caller instead, so the
# caller's session stays open.
